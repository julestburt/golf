First off, thank YOU!

It's thanks to people like you that the project thrives :)
If you are reading this, it means you want to contribute to this project one way or another.

Our vision for Then is to simplify swift async code on all platforms running Swift code.

We are very open to contributions and any ideas that can improve the project !

## How can I contribute?

- Report a bug or strange behavior via an issue
- Suggest a new feature via an issue
- Open a pull request

In order to maximize your pull request approval, you may want to open an issue first.
That way the addition or change can be discussed, so that you don't waste time on a feature that might be rejected later.


When you issue a change, make sure you run the unit tests (Cmd+U) and check all pass.

When adding a new feature, it's best if you can add the corresponding unit tests. If this is new to you, no problem, the team can help you
or add the unit tests for you :)
