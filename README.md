Golf Leaderboard Tech Test

This was an overnight response to a tech test offered to me by a local development company. I rather liked their approach, in that it wasn't some abstract academic geeky cleverness or the 'current challenging issue at work' repackaged as a technical test...no this was good old real world.

The test was focussed on getting some data from a server and then displaying it on a screen (or two).

I read the assignment through on Sunday morning as I knew I wouldn't be starting until around 7PM as I had plans for Sunday already, plus I do ike to think about a problem a little before tackling anyway, plus I had already had plans for Sunday.

I decided just to make it as 'clean' as I could - in terms of size of functions, one purpose for each, clear deliniation between and a good split between view code, presenter code and interactors / business modesl and ultimately the core entities. This would make a good unit test candidate also.

I'd initially, decided to start the project fresh. I tried to replicate an existing project, but there was so much to change I quickly moved to a new project.I got a new project going, and decided to focus on the visual. A table of sorts. Knowing how I'd like to plumb the other data areas in.

Building this tech test I wanted to really show how I could 'model' the problem in a very logical way. This certainly wasn't proof of perfect encapsulation, or unit testing - but it was an exercise in constructing a solution for the outlined requirement.

I spent ~8 hours generating this app. As always there was a couple of pesky issues I faced, one with an added framework crashing the app and another with some weird access of an arrary thay always returned nil, despite there clearly being data within (the range).

If I'd had a little more time I would've tested the app more along with 'challenging' server responses. Also, as I've just learnt about and started writing unit tests last week this would also of been a good additional step to take. I've realized whilst the value in unit testing on mobile may not have initially been self evident - it certainly helps incredibly around any refactoring. I think that's been my experience in just a few days of use.

Anyway, I hope it is seen as a good response from the company - they seem very neat so far. As always I look forward to hearing feedback, good or bad and learning from the experience.
